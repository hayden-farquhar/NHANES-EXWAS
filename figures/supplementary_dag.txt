# Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for Covariate Selection

The following DAG justifies the covariate selection for the primary analysis model:

## Exposure-Outcome Pathway

The primary question is whether chemical exposure (E) affects health outcome (Y):

    E -> Y

## Confounders Adjusted

1. **Age** -> E, Y
   - Older individuals have longer cumulative exposure (E)
   - Age affects nearly all health outcomes (Y)
   - Classic confounder; must adjust

2. **Sex** -> E, Y
   - Sex differences in exposure patterns (occupation, diet)
   - Sex differences in metabolism and health outcomes
   - Classic confounder; must adjust

3. **Race/Ethnicity** -> E, Y
   - Proxy for socioeconomic factors affecting exposure
   - Associated with health outcomes via multiple pathways
   - Classic confounder; must adjust (collapsed to 3 levels for stability)

4. **Poverty-Income Ratio (PIR)** -> E, Y
   - Lower SES -> higher environmental exposures
   - Lower SES -> worse health outcomes
   - Classic confounder; must adjust

5. **BMI** -> E, Y (when Y is not anthropometric)
   - Higher BMI can dilute blood biomarker concentrations
   - BMI affects metabolic, cardiovascular outcomes
   - Confounder for non-anthropometric outcomes
   - OMITTED when Y = BMI or waist circumference (collider)

6. **Smoking** -> E, Y
   - Smoking is a major source of chemical exposure
   - Smoking independently affects health outcomes
   - Classic confounder; must adjust

## Potential Mediators (NOT adjusted)

- **Metabolic pathways** (glucose, lipids, etc.)
  - May be on the causal pathway from E to Y
  - Adjusting would block causal effect
  - NOT adjusted in primary analysis

## Potential Colliders (NOT adjusted or carefully handled)

- **BMI when Y is anthropometric**
  - If E -> BMI and E -> waist, BMI is a collider
  - Adjusting would induce spurious association
  - BMI is OMITTED from models with BMI or waist as outcome

## Limitations of DAG

1. Assumes no unmeasured confounding (strong assumption)
2. Diet, physical activity, medications not directly measured
3. Linear age assumption (no age^2 term in primary model)
4. Race/ethnicity collapsed (effect modification possible)
5. Cross-sectional design cannot establish temporality
